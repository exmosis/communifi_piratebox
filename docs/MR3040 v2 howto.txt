Instructions for MR3040 v2.

- Set switch to WISP mode.

- make sure you have a copy of openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3040-v2-squashfs-factory.bin firmware file. Currently I'm using the ecco one.

- connect box to computer via ethernet, turn off other networking

- turn on box

- browse to 192.168.0.254 or 192.168.0.1 (more likely) - username is admin / admin

- go to "System Tools" > "Firmware Upgrade" and upload the firmware file above. Box will restart.

- Computer should now pick up a 192.168.1.x IP from the box. Telnet to 192.168.1.1

- Type 'passwd' to set the root password

- edit /etc/config/network - I actually do this by copying it to /tmp first due to the squashfs, then copying back to /etc/config. 

- add the following lines to the end:

        option gateway '192.168.1.254'
        list dns '192.168.1.254'
        list dns '8.8.8.8'

where 192.168.1.254 is your outbound net router. (8.8.8.8 is google DNS)

- save the file, turn off the box, and plug it into your router instead. Switch the box on. switch on internet on your computer.

- ssh to root@192.168.1.1 (if setting up several boxes, you probably want to add an entry to /etc/hosts file first, to avoid SSH conflicts)

- if you connect ok, check you can ping google.com

- set up USB:

opkg update
opkg install kmod-usb-uhci
insmod usbcore ## may return: file exists
insmod uhci
opkg install kmod-usb-ohci ## may return: up to date.
insmod usb-ohci

- get your USB drive ready, FAT32 formatted - insert it in the box

- run: opkg install http://stable.openwrt.piratebox.de/all/packages/pbxopkg_0.0.4_all.ipk - this will install matthias' pb repo 

- so you can then just doâ€¦

opkg update && opkg install piratebox

and then waiiiit. 

- disconnect the box from the router, then reboot as it suggest. you may need to do

reboot -f


###### Installing other pb images

- Install the timesave script

/opt/piratebox/bin/timesave.sh /opt/piratebox/conf/piratebox.conf install 

- Reconnect the box to the net and ssh in again.

- turn off DNS interception

/etc/init.d/piratebox nodns

opkg update

opkg install piratebox-mesh
opkg install piratebox-forban


##### Install git and get communifi repo

- Install git 

opkg update && opkg install -d piratebox git

- Setup links (unless you've installed MiniDLNA already)

ln -s /mnt/ext/usr/bin/git /usr/bin
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> /etc/profile
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib'  >> /etc/profile
source /etc/profile

(These are needed for MiniDLNA too)

- Set up a new SSH key for the box

mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh
dropbearkey -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/communifi_rsa

- This will print out a big long line starting with 'ssh-rsa'. Copy everything from and including this up to the end. (N.B. If you need to get this again, use 'dropbearkey -y -f ~/.ssh/communifi_rsa' )

- Log into the communifi github account and add this as an SSH key to the account settings. Label it with the box name.

- Create a dropbear command to connect to github

cd
vim gitssh.sh
Add the following lines:

#!/bin/sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/communifi_rsa $*

Add permissions to the file:

chmod a+x ~/gitssh.sh

export GIT_SSH=~/gitssh.sh

And add to profile

echo 'export GIT_SSH=~/gitssh.sh'  >> /etc/profile

- Move the existing www and bin directories out of the way

cd /opt/piratebox
mv bin bin_pb_orig
mv www www_pb_orig

- Clone the communifi repo on the dev branch

git clone -b dev git@github.com:exmosis/communifi_pb_opt.git
mv communifi_pb_opt/* ./
mv communifi_pb_opt/.git ./
rm -rf communifi_pb_opt

(N.B. If you get a password prompt, you probably need to run '/etc/init.d/piratebox nodns')

### Install DLNA next

(Taken from http://piratebox.aod-rpg.de/dokuwiki/doku.php/openwrt/upnpmediaserver)

opkg update
opkg install minidlna -d piratebox
ln -s  /mnt/ext/etc/config/minidlna /etc/config/
ln -s  /mnt/ext/etc/init.d/minidlna /etc/init.d/
ln -s /mnt/ext/usr/bin/minidlna /usr/bin
ln -s /mnt/ext/usr/sbin/minidlnad /usr/sbin  

cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.piratebox.de/openwrt.example.minidlna 
cp openwrt.example.minidlna   /mnt/ext/etc/config/minidlna

- Edit the MiniDLNA config to change the friendly name

vi /etc/config/minidlna

	edit friendly_name
	change notify_interval to 300

/etc/init.d/minidlna disable
sed 's|START=50|START=85\nSTOP=01|' -i /etc/init.d/minidlna
sed 's/exit 0/#exit 0/' -i /etc/rc.local
echo 'sleep 10' >> /etc/rc.local
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> /etc/rc.local
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib' >> /etc/rc.local
echo '/etc/init.d/minidlna restart' >> /etc/rc.local
/etc/init.d/minidlna enable

- Start it

/etc/init.d/minidlna start


#### Change Wireless ID

Edit 
/etc/config/wireless 
and 
/etc/piratebox.common

#### Change hostname

Edit
/etc/config/system
/etc/hosts


#### Change http name

Edit /etc/piratebox.common (1 line)
Edit /etc/config/dhcp (config domain)
Edit /etc/hosts (all lines)

Make sure /opt/piratebox/bin/generate_config_files.sh has DNS redirect srt o #
Edit /opt./piratebox/bi/droopy to use right name



#### Portal box


1. Add external DNS to PB for use by DHCP clients connecting, by
adding this to /etc/piratebox.common alongside the "nameserver
127.0.0.1" line:

  echo "nameserver 192.168.1.254" >> /tmp/resolv.conf

Were 192.168.1.254 is my router. Suspect using 8.8.8.8 is easier for
portability.

2. Comment out the 'no-resolv' setting in
/opt/piratebox/conf/dnsmasq_default.conf to allow the box to use other
DNS servers (specified, I believe, in /etc/config/network as 'dns'
options)

Also uncomment 'dhcp-authoritative'

3. Amend the PB config generation script at
/opt/piratebox/bin/generate_config_files.sh to only redirect a single
domain name, changing:

  dns_redirect="/#/$net.$ip_pb"

to:

  dns_redirect="/piratebox.lan/$net.$ip_pb"

(Actually, I've changed mine to redirect exmosis.cb, but same thing)

4. Enable iptables by editing /etc/sysctl.conf and commenting out:

  net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0

5. I found I had to tell iptables to be permissive, as it seemed
locked down by default. I added this to /etc/firewall.user:

  iptables -I zone_wan_ACCEPT -j ACCEPT

6. I then had a problem getting my laptop to take the DNS from the PB.
After a long search, I found DHCP from the box was getting overridden
by DHCP on the main net router, so disallowed DHCP traffic through the
PB. I think this means I can connect to either the wifi on the PB, and
use the DHCP/DNS on it, or connect to the wifi on my router as normal,
and not worry about it, but need to test this. Anyway, added this to
the /etc/firewall.user script too:

  iptables -I FORWARD -p udp --dport 67:68 --sport 67:68 -j DROP
